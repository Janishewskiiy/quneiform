Introduction
============

This is experimental branch of Cuneiform that actively refactored.
Also it has simple GUI for testing and development purposes written on Qt4.

Building
========

Extract the source and go to the root folder (the one this file is in).
Then type the following commands:

	mkdir ../builddir
	cd ../builddir	
	cmake ..
	make
	make install 

By default Cuneiform installs to /usr/local. You can specify a different prefix
by giving a command line switch "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/what/ever/you/want"
to CMake.
