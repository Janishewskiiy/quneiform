Main goals are:
    1. code cleanup and such refactoring as removing tons of global variables, cast to void* etc.
    
    2. make cuneiform work on NetBSD, OpenBSD and OpenSolaris platforms (now it compiles, but segfaults)
    
    3. compiling with MSVC
    
    4. remove a lot of duplicated code
    
    5. add multilanguage support
